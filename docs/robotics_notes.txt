Decision making:
	1. Robot and competitions participation related (technical):
		Kids will make decisions with consensus.
		In the absense of consensus majority with veto power to minority.
		Adults/coaches can only ask guiding questions :).
	2. Non tech decisions:
		Parents with consensus. If no consensus, majority with veto power to minority.
	3. Team composition decisions:
		Both parents and kids with consensus. In the absense of consensus, majority with veto power to minority.
		
Work assignments:

Kids:
1. Setup (One time)
	a. Laoptop/tablet to code and use (no need to have a dedicated one just for robotics)
	b. Minimal electric kit: 
		i. (Hex screw driver/allen keys etc
		ii. Anti static gloves/protective goggles (if no specs ) 
		- looks like static is a big issue and keeps frying vex vrc brains
	c. Accounts (free):
		i. Github (github.com)
		ii. Trello (https://trello.com/w/infinity2324/home)/another options is Asana (Let's chat more whether we need a time tracker/PM app)
		iii. Cad software (autodesk.com/products/fusion360 Please get a student account)
		iv. Social media presense (?? A couple of videos over the season on youtube seems about right)
2. Ongoing:
	a. Be present for regular building/practice
	b. Contribute to planning and building
	c. Contribute to engineering book
	d. Work on your planned activity
	e. Be kind and have fun!

Parents/coaches:
1. Setup (one time):
	a. Get kids to setup required accounts
	b. Ensure that they have the required devices
	c. Setup splitwise account (splitwise.com/splitwise app)
2. Ongoing:
	a. Time/coaching commitments (in round robin):
		(It helps if there is an adult watching over them to guide them/resolve conflicts/keep focus)
	b. Snacks/food:
		A well fed student is a productive student :).
		It is possible that kids may work through a day/late in the night. Lunch/dinner needs to be pre-arranged.
		(We have observed that it is easier if we plan for this)
	c. Tournament tracking and booking
	d. (For each tournament) Plan and arrange for travel/stay as required
	e. Check splitwise balances
